# expand-region-subword

Additional expansions for `expand-region` when `subword-mode` is enabled.

This functionality was originally included with the excellent
[expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region) package, but
has now been split into a separate package.

## Installation

This package should soon be available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/).

To install manually, clone the repo and add the following to your emacs
configuration:

``` emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/expand-region-subword")
(require 'expand-region-subword')
```
